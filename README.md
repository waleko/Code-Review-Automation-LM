## Overview

Code review is a crucial aspect of the software development process, ensuring that code changes are thoroughly examined
for quality, security, and adherence to coding standards. However, the code review process can be time-consuming, and
human reviewers may overlook certain issues. To address these challenges, we have developed a Code Review Automation
system powered by language models.

Our system leverages state-of-the-art language models to generate code reviews automatically. These models are trained
on a vast corpus of code and can provide insightful feedback on code changes. By automating part of the code review
process, our system aims to:

- Speed up the code review process.
- Identify common code issues and provide recommendations.
- Assist developers in producing higher-quality code.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Collection

Our system collects code review data from popular GitHub repositories. This data includes code changes and associated
human-authored code reviews. By leveraging this data, our models learn to generate contextually relevant code reviews.

### 2. Model Inference and Fine-Tuning

We use pre-trained language models and fine-tune them on code review datasets. Fine-tuning allows the models to
specialize in generating code reviews, making them more effective in this task.

Once the models are trained, they can generate code reviews for new code changes. These generated reviews can highlight
potential issues, suggest improvements, and provide feedback to developers.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics

We use the BLEU-4 score metric to assess the quality of generated code reviews. This metric measures the similarity
between model-generated reviews and target human reviews. While our models provide valuable assistance, they are
designed to complement human reviewers.

## Getting Started

To get started with our Code Review Automation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waleko/Code-Review-Automation-LM.git
   cd Code-Review-Automation-LM
   ```

2. Set up the required dependencies and environment (see `requirements.txt`).

3. Run the provided notebooks to explore data collection, model inference, and evaluation.

4. Integrate the code review automation system into your development workflow. You can use our pre-trained models or
   fine-tune them on your specific codebase for even better results.
